======================================

The OWASP Hackademic Challenges Project helps you test your knowledge on web application security. You can use it to attack web applications in a realistic but also controllable and safe environment.

The Hackademic Challenges implement realistic scenarios with known vulnerabilities in a safe and controllable environment. Users can attempt to discover and exploit these vulnerabilities in order to learn important concepts of information security through an attacker's perspective.
